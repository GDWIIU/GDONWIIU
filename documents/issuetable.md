Creating pull requests
-----------------------
If you want to fix an issue yourself or add an aditional feature you can fork the main repository, create a pull request and if your code makes it into the final project you will be credited in ( .github/CODEOWNERS and CONTRIBUTING.md )

    1. Go to the fork menu of the repositoy https://github.com/GDWIIU/GDONWIIU/fork and create a fork of the repository

    2. Edit the repository how ever you like. Adding features, fixing broken code or just refactoring

    3. Once finished go to your repos pull requests tab and click create pull request

    4. Add a title and a general description of what you added/changed

    5. Create pull request

Pull requests are frequently checked while new updates are in development but it is not guaranteed that your code is going to make it into the final alpha version of a new update
